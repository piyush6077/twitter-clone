suppose there are two user 

john and jane 

the id of john is 1
the id of jane is 2 


             
        john                                    jane 

    following[]                               following[]                                                   
    follower[]                                follower[]


when jane follow john the id of which is 2 will be added into the follower array of the john 
and following array of the jane 
    i.e john   follower[2]
        jane   following[2]
and vise versa 


now similarly if jenny is the third person with the id 3 and now she follows john then the follower[] of the john will be :
    i.e john  follower[2,3]
