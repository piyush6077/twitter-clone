// const isPasswordCorrect = await bcrypt.compare(password , user?.password || "")

here we dycrypt the passowrd from the database 
by using the bcrypt package

await bcrypt.compare( passwordProvidedByUser , databasePassword || "" )

the ? and || are some type of ternary operator which if user.password not found then compare 
the passwordProvidedByUser with the empty string in this way the bcrypt will not give errors
